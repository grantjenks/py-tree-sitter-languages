Tree-sitter languages
=====================

Binary Python wheels for many tree-sitter languages.

`py-tree-sitter`_ is a fantastic library that provides Python bindings for the
even more fantastic `tree-sitter`_ parsing library.

`py-tree-sitter-languages`_ provides binary Python wheels for many tree sitter
languages that do not have their own packages.

Install
=======

.. code:: bash

   pip install tree-sitter-languages


**Note:** building from source requires ``git`` and a C compiler.

Usage
=====

.. code:: python

   from tree_sitter_languages import get_language, get_parser

   language = get_language("rst")
   parser = get_parser("rst")

That's the whole API!

Refer to `py-tree-sitter`_ for the language and parser API.
